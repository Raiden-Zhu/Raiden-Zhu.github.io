Our paper "Decentralized SGD and Average-direction SAM are Asymptotically Equivalent" is accpeted by **ICML 2023**! 
- This is the first work on the surprising sharpness-aware minimization nature of decentralized learning. 
- We provide a completely new perspective to understand decentralization, which helps to bridge the gap between theory and practice in decentralized learning.
