I am Tongtian Zhu (prounced as "Tong-tee-an Joo"), a second-year PhD student at the CS Department of [**Zhejiang University**](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (ZJU), under the auspices of Professor [**Mingli Song**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong) and Academician [**Chun Chen**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0082004). I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematical Science from CUMTB, as well as my B.Econ. degree in Economics (double degree) from [**Peking University**](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU) in 2021. In the same year, I joined [**JD Explore Academy**](https://corporate.jd.com/) (JDE) as a a research intern, where I focused on the generalization theory of decentralized learning (or swarm learning), fortunately supervised by Doctor [**Fengxiang He**](https://fengxianghe.github.io/) and Professor [**Dacheng Tao**](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html).

### Research interest

In the science aspect, my primary research interest lies in understanding the mechanisms underpining the practical success of deep learning. My ultimate goal is to understand the emergence of intelligence (both machine intelligence and biological intelligence).
In the technology aspect, I am passionate about developing machine learning methodologies inspired by principles.

My current research focuses on examining the theoretical foundations of **decentralized learning** (or swarm learning). I am also dedicated to utilizing elegant theoretical insights to construct fast and generalizable decentralized learning algorithms.
