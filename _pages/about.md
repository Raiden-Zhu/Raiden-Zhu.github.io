Hi there ðŸ˜ƒ. I am Tongtian Zhu (prounced as "Tong-tee-an Joo"), a Ph.D. candidate at the Computer Science Department of [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), supervised by Professors [Can Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/wangcan) and [Chun Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0082004). <!-- I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematical Science from CUMTB, as well as my B.Econ. degree in Economics (double degree) from [<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #B509AC;">Peking University</span>](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (PKU) in 2021. --> 
Previously, I held a research internship at [JD Explore Academy (JDE)](https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-unveils-four-new-enterprise-level-products/jd-explore-academy/), working on the generalization theory of decentralized learning,  mentored by Doctor [Fengxiang He](https://fengxianghe.github.io/) and Professor [Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html).
I am open to both academic and industry opportunities. If you have matched opportunities, questions, or are interested in collaborating, or just want to chat, please always feel free to contact me via [**email**](mailto:raiden@zju.edu.cn) or [**WeChat**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Raiden-Zhu/Raiden-Zhu.github.io/master/assets/img/WeChat_QR_code.jpg).  <!-- For regular updates and insights, feel free to follow my [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/Raiden13238619) as well. -->

### <span style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-weight: bold;">ðŸ¦„ Research Interest</span>

<small><em>"Seek truth and beauty."</em></small>

My primary research interest lies in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underpinning the practical success of deep learning, including LLMs. I am also interested in developing machine learning methodologies inspired by principles.

My current research focus includes:
- **Science of deep learning** (e.g., [symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09189) in neural networks' weight space, [training dynamics of gradient methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02913));
- **Theory of decentralized learning** (e.g., [generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12680), [data influence](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2TIYkqieKw));
- **Efficient & trustworthy learning algorithms**.
