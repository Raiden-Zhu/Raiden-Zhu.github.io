I am a second-year PhD student at [**Zhejiang University**](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), under the auspices of Professors [**Mingli Song**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong) and [**Chun Chen**](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0082004). I earned my B.S. degree in Mathematical Science from [**China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)**](https://english.cumtb.edu.cn/), as well as my B.Econ. degree in Economics (double degree) from [**Peking University**](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021. In the same year, I served as a a research intern at [**JD Explore Academy**](https://corporate.jd.com/), where I focused on the generalization theory of decentralized learning (or swarm learning), fortunately supervised by JD algorithm scientist [**Fengxiang He**](https://fengxianghe.github.io/) and Professor [**Dacheng Tao**](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html).
