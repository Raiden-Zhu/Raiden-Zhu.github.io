  abstract = 	 {This paper studies the algorithmic stability and generalizability of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD). We prove that the consensus model learned by D-SGD is \mathcal{O}{(N^{-1}+ m^{-1} +\lambda^2)}\mathcal{O}{(N^{-1}+ m^{-1} +\lambda^2)}-stable in expectation in the non-convex non-smooth setting, where NN is the total sample size, mm is the worker number, and 1+\lambda1+\lambda is the spectral gap that measures the connectivity of the communication topology. These results then deliver an \mathcal{O}{(N^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+ m^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+\lambda^{1+\alpha} + \phi_S)}\mathcal{O}{(N^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+ m^{-(1+\alpha)/2}+\lambda^{1+\alpha} + \phi_S)} in-average generalization bound, which is non-vacuous even when \lambda\lambda is closed to 11, in contrast to vacuous as suggested by existing literature on the projected version of D-SGD. Our theory indicates that the generalizability of D-SGD is positively correlated with the spectral gap, and can explain why consensus control in initial training phase can ensure better generalization. Experiments of VGG-11 and ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet justify our theory. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on the topology-aware generalization of vanilla D-SGD.},

  abstract = 	 {Decentralized stochastic gradient descent (D-SGD) allows collaborative learning on massive device simultaneously without the control of a central server. Sharpness-aware minimization, or SAM, is a popular optimization technique that effectively improves model generalization by explicitly minimizing a sharpness-based measure alongside the training loss. In this paper, we prove that D-SGD asymptotically minimizes the loss function of an average-direction SAM. This asymptotic equivalence further demonstrates three advantages of D-SGD: (1) D-SGD exhibits a gradient smoothing effect; (2) there exists an uncertainty self-estimating mechanism in D-SGD to improve posterior estimation; and (3) the sharpness regularization effect of D-SGD does not decrease as total batch size increases, which justifies the superiority of D-SGD over centralized SGD (C-SGD) in large-batch settings. We conduct extensive experiments which are in full agreement with our theory. Our code will be made publicly available.},

  abstract = {Value Decomposition (VD) aims to deduce the contributions of agents for decentralized policies in the presence of only global rewards, and has recently emerged as a powerful credit assignment paradigm for tackling cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. One of the main challenges in VD is to promote diverse behaviors among agents, while existing methods directly encourage the diversity of learned agent networks with various strategies. However, we argue that these dedicated designs for agent networks are still limited by the indistinguishable VD network, leading to homogeneous agent behaviors and thus downgrading the cooperation capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Identity-Aware learning (CIA) method, explicitly boosting the credit-level distinguishability of the VD network to break the bottleneck of multi-agent diversity. Specifically, our approach leverages contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between the temporal credits and identity representations of different agents, encouraging the full expressiveness of credit assignment and further the emergence of individualities. The algorithm implementation of the proposed CIA module is simple yet effective that can be readily incorporated into various VD architectures. Experiments on the SMAC benchmarks and across different VD backbones demonstrate that the proposed method yields results superior to the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code is available at this https URL.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks~(GNNs) have emerged as a powerful category of learning architecture for handling graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs typically ignore crucial structural characteristics in node-induced subgraphs, which thus limits their expressiveness for various downstream tasks. In this paper, we strive to strengthen the representative capabilities of GNNs by devising a dedicated plug-and-play normalization scheme, termed as SUbgraph-sPEcific FactoR Embedded Normalization (SuperNorm), that explicitly considers the intra-connection information within each node-induced subgraph. To this end, we embed the subgraph-specific factor at the beginning and the end of the standard BatchNorm, as well as incorporate graph instance-specific statistics for improved distinguishable capabilities. In the meantime, we provide theoretical analysis to support that, with the elaborated SuperNorm, an arbitrary GNN is at least as powerful as the 1-WL test in distinguishing non-isomorphism graphs. Furthermore, the proposed SuperNorm scheme is also demonstrated to alleviate the over-smoothing phenomenon. Experimental results related to predictions of graph, node, and link properties on the eight popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
